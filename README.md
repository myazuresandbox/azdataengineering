The Setup Introduction
In recent years, Machine Learning has received a lot of attention due to the progress
made in research. Many companies would like to leverage the opportunities offered by
these techniques or perform Business Analytics but struggle to do so, because their data
is locked up in silos like in OLTP databases containing operational data. Historically, there
have been two main approaches to utilize data for analytical and Machine Learning
purposes:
1. With a Data Warehouse
2. With a Data Lake
Access to the data is granted by utilizing ETL (Data Warehouse) or ELT (Data Lake)
processes. While the concept of a Data Lake is mostly about avoiding to transfer data
and keeping it where it is, Data Warehouses focus on transforming and storing data in a
way that enables lightning-fast analytical queries. Setting up the appropriate Data
Architecture is absolutely crucial to the success of not only classical analytical solutions
but also Machine Learning Algorithms. With this short introduction, we would like to
welcome you to our tutorial series about Data Engineering on MS Azure!
Target
In this tutorial, we are going to teach you how to:
Set up the appropriate resources on Azure and manage their access to each other
Build pipelines in Data Factory that can read, transform, partition, and write data
Set up appropriate star schemas in the Azure Data Warehouse Solution 'Synapse'
